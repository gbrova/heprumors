## Why?

When high energy physics grad students and postdocs apply to and accept postdoc positions, they share 
updates on the [rumor mill](https://sites.google.com/site/postdocrumor/). 

Instead of refreshing a webpage every 7 minutes, why not follow 
[@heprumors](https://twitter.com/heprumors) for the latest news? 

## About

This is a simple python script to periodically refresh a Google Drive spreadsheet and
post updates on Twitter. 

To use: 

1. `mv auth.json.example auth.json` and fill in the credentials, then 
2. `python heprumors.py`
